After 9 months of using a git bare repo to manage my dotfiles, I've decided to move back to using `stow`. Although I initially enjoyed the simplicity of the bare repo, I found that:
* Constantly having to use the `cfg` alias over `git` went against muscle memory
* Command line completion wasn't as robust
* It didn't give me the same convenience of seeing the repo's status or branch on `PS1`
* I couldn't use tools like `git-gutter` to see commit chunks while text editing
